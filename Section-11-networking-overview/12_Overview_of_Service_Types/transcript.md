Hello everyone, and welcome back. 

So far we've only looked at one type of service, and that's the nodeport service. However there are a few other service types, and you can list them out using the explain command. 

```
$ kubectl explain service.spec.type
```

I'll give demos for these service types as we go through the course. But for now I just wanted to give you a high level overview of them. so by the end of this video, you'll have a better understanding what these service type      are, how they are different from each other, and under what circumstances one service type is  better suited over another.

Now we've already seen how the nodeport service works, As illustrated in this diagram. 

Here we saw that we needed to setup    a load balancer to allow outside traffic into our kube   cluster. 

In this example we have our kube cluster on AWS. So a typical way to create this AWS loadbalancer would by via the aws web console. However you can also get Kubernetes to create this loadbalancer for you. And that's what the loadbalancer service type is  for. That means that you can write out a loadbalancer service yaml file, and then just apply it, in the same way that you do with any  other yaml files. 

I personally find the loadbalancer service type a little     . That's because they effectively make Kubernetes manage objects that live outside of the cluster. All the yaml definitions we've encountered so far were to do with building objects inside the cluster, so loadbalancer service   falls out-of-step with that.

Next we have clusterIP services. 

Let's say you don't want to expose your pods to the outside world. In that scenario you won't need any   loadbalancers. And for that matter, also don't want your service listening for outside traffic via the nodeport number. That's where clusterIP services comes to the rescue. 

ClusterIP services are similar to nodeport services. The key difference is that they don't listen for external traffic. In otherwords. That's why, I often think of clusterIP services as a cut down version of nodeport services.

ClusterIP is also the default service type, meaning that if you don't explicitly specify the service type in your yaml file then kubernetes will assume it to be clusterIP.

Theres another object type that's often used in conjunction with this service type. And that's Ingress objects. Ingress objects provides another way to allow external traffic into your cluster. You can configure your ingress objects to receive outside traffic, then forward it to one or more clusterIP services.

This combination of clusterIP and ingress is a really powerful and popular alternative to using nodeport services. One reason for that is that unlike nodeport services, this pairing let's you're kube cluster accept outside traffic on standard port numbers. We'll go into more detail about all of this later in the course. 

And finally we have the externalname Service.

Now there can be situations where you want your pods to access a resource outside the cluster, for example, a mysql database. Now, let's say our mysql database has a long and complicated endpoint.

Our pods can use this endpoint as is. However this endpoint is quite long and unweildy. It would be if we had a more human readable endpoint. And that's possible thanks to Externalname services . 

Put simply, externalname services are used for adding custom c-name entries to Kubernetes DNS. It's a bit like giving another name to an existing dns name. So in this scenario you can write a yaml file for your ExternalName service that associates you're new dns name with the existing mysql db's endpoint. Also your new dns name will look like an ordinary Kubernetes dns name 


Then apply that yaml file so that your new dns entry get's added to Kubernetes DNS. After that, Your pods can then use the new simpler endpoint. 

Ok, That's it for this video, see you in the next one.
