## Trip this as a journey so far checklist. 

## create recap videos once the rest of the course has been completed. 

cover the big diagram from the trailer. 

I'm now going to introduce you to a lot of new terminologies here. A lot of them want make sense to you, and that's ok beacuase at this stage I'm just trying to seed them in your mind. basically I'm tring to show you all the dots, and the rest of the course will draw the lines to connect all those dots.  

So I recommend circling back and rewatch this video as you progress through the course and you'll see stuff will start clicking and falling into place. 


By the end of this course, you'll learn:

- Setup your very own Kubernetes Environment using Minikube
- Run containers by creating pods
- Get pods talking to each other by creating services
- Create a group of identical pods using Replicasets and Deployments
- Create Ingress rules to make your pods accessible to the outside world
- Store your pod's data using Persistent Volumes and Persistant Volume Claims.
- ...AND Create all of these objects by first writng yaml files and then feeding these files to kubernetes
