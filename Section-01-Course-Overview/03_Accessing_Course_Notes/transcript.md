Each video comes with it's own set of course notes. These course notes provides information specific for that the particular video. They include:


- copies of the commands and example files that I used. So after watching a video you can then try following along on your local workstation.

- A section about alternative approaches - There can be several ways to perform the same task in Kubernets. When that's the case I'll Usually go over 1, or maybe 2 approaches in the video and I'll cover the others in the course notes.


- I've included links to any online resources, such as github repos and blog articles, as well as links to official documentations. Use these links if you're interested into exploring a particular video in more detail.

The course notes can also have sections for FAQs, common pitfalls, troubleshooting tips, terminologies, and so on.


All these course notes are actually stored under a single github repo, called the Kubernetes Study Guide, you can treat this as a companion study guide for this course. so feel free to fork it and add your own notes to them.Â
