Chrome -> vscode

Each video comes with some course notes. These notes have all the example commands and sample files I used for each video.

So after watching a video I recommend that you take a look at these notes and try following along on your local workstation. I cannot stress enough how important it is that you practice by actually using Kubernetes rather than just watching the videos. It help you to get comfortable with and helps to bed what you learn.

There can be several ways to perform the same kubernetes task. When that's the case I'll Usually cover 1, or maybe 2 approaches in the video and I'll mention the rest in the course notes.


I've included links to all online resources that I mention in each video, such as github repos and blog articles, and links to the official documentations. I've also include links to other resources that expands on the topics covered in the video and gives more indepth info.

Where relevant, I've added other sections in the course notes too, such as FAQs, common pitfalls, and a section about troubleshooting tips, terminologies, and etc. 


There's also a study guide to accompany this course which you can find on github.Â
