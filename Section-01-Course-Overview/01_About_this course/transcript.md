Hello Everyone, my name is Sher Chowdhury and welcome to my course, Kubernetes by example

I am based in the UK and I've been working in IT for about 15 years, both for the Government, and in the private sector. 

In 2019 I passed the Kubernetes exam and became a certified kubernetes administrator. 

If you are watching this video then the chances are your interested in knowing about kubernetes. 

Kubernetes is taking the IT world by storm, and it looks like it's here to stay. In fact more and more organissations are adopting Kubernetes every day. They range from startups, to big companies like banks and retailers, and other organisatoins such as the goverment. 

The adoption rate is so fast, that Eventually those who aren't using kubernetes will become the minority. 

This course is specifically designed to be a handson guide. So that you can follow along and get practical experience using Kubernetes. 


And as you progress through the rest of the course, you will get hands-on experience with the more advanced features of Kubernetes.

The ideal person for this course is a Linux user who has some basic Docker experience. In case you want to  become a Certified Kuberenetes Administrator, then this course is a great starting point as well. That's because we'll be hands-on, just like the exam itself. We'll also provide you with lots of exam tips and best practice guidance along the way. 

So feel free to take a look at the course description, and I look forward to seeing you inside.
