Kubernetes is one of those technologies that has a reasonably high barrier of entry. Meaning that you need to be competent on a few other areas before you can start learning Kubernentes. 

broadly speaking there are 3 areas that you need to have prior experience in before starting this course. They are:

- Linux - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19Q9520MT-FoNWIH5OzyW7eJLsmrJJLwjdnWS-40-dYk/edit?usp=sharing
- docker - 
- and some Cloud Experience - such as AWS, Azure, GCP (nice to have)


First you need to know Linux and have lots of experience using a bash terminal. Let's do a quick test, ask yourself how many of these commands do you have experience in using:


Don't worry if you don't know all of them. This is more a finger in the air test in order to gage how much you know.


If your answer is that you know most, if not all of them, then it's safe to say that you meet this requirement. If not, then I would suggest brushing up your Linux skills before continuing with this course.


Next, you need to have handson experience with Docker. You need to know what docker images and containers are? and how they are used in the real world. That's important because Kubernetes is a Container orchestration platform so if you don't know what containers are in the first place then this course will go over your head.


Here's another quick fire test to check what your docker knowledge is like.


Once again This is to only give you a general idea of the level you should be at before starting this course.
If you're familiar with most of these commands, then I would say you're good to go. Otherwise, I would say take some time out and get up to speed with docker.

Finally it would help if you have experience in using a cloud platform such as AWS or Microsoft Azure. That's mainly because kubernetes has a lot concept that are similar to cloud concepts such as making things high-available and immutable. But don't worry if you don't have any cloud experience. We'll be explaining these concepts as we go through this course.
