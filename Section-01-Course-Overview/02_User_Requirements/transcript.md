Slides -> bash terminal

Kubernetes has quite a high barrier of entry, meaning that you can't learn Kubernetes without having experience in other technologies, in particular linux and docker:

- Linux
- Kubernetes
- Cloud platforms (aws, azure,...etc)


First you need to know Linux and have lots of experience using a bash terminal. To gage how much you know, Let's do a quick check and see how many of these commands you know and have used. 

Knowing about what these commands would by extension mean that you're familiar with underlying concepts such as processes, netowrking, filesystems and so on. If you have experience with using most of these commands then it's safe to say you meet this requirement.


If not, then I would suggest stopping here and brushing up your Linux skills before continuing with this course.



The 2nd thing you need to have experience with is Docker. What are docker images and containers? and how they are used in the real world. That's important because Kubernetes is a Container orchestration platform so if you don't know what containers are in the first place then a lot of this course won't make sense to you.


Here's another quick fire check to see what your docker knowledge is like.


If you're familiar with most of these commands, then I would say you're good to go. Otherwise I suggest you take some time to learn docker instead.


This should give you a general idea, of the level you should be at before starting this course.
