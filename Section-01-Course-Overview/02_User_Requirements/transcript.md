Kubernetes has quite a high barrier of entry, meaning that you can't learn Kubernetes without having experience in other technologies, in particular linux and docker:

- Linux
- docker
- Cloud platforms (aws, azure,...etc)


First you need to know Linux and have lots of experience using a bash terminal. To gage how much you know, ask yourself how many of these commands have you used:





If your answer is most if not all of them, then it's safe to say you meet this requirement. If not, then I would suggest stopping here and brushing up your Linux skills before continuing with this course. Knowing how to use these commands would alos by extension mean that you're familiar with underlying concepts, such as filesystems, networking, processes,...and so on.





Secondly you need to have handson experience with Docker. You need to know what docker images and containers are? and how they are used in the real world. That's important because Kubernetes is a Container orchestration platform so if you don't know what containers are in the first place then most of these course will go over your head.


Here's another quick fire check to gage what your docker knowledge is like.


This should give you a general idea, of the level you should be at before starting this course.
If you're familiar with most of these commands, then I would say you're good to go. Otherwise you should take a step bakc and get up to speed with docker.
