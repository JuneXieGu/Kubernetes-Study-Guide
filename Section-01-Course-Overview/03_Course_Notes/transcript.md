Each video comes with it's own set of course notes. These course notes provides information that's specific for that  particular video. They include:

- I've included links to any online resources, such as github repos and blog articles, as well as links to official documentations. Use these links if you're interested in exploring a particular topic in more detail.

The course notes can also have sections for FAQs, common pitfalls, troubleshooting tips, terminologies, and so on.


All these course notes are actually stored under a single github repo, called the Kubernetes Study Guide, you can treat this as a companion study guide for this course. so feel free to fork it and add your own notes to them.Â
