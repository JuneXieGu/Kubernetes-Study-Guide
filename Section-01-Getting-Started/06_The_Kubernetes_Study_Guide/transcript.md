Chrome -> vscode

Each video comes with some course notes. These notes have all the example commands and sample files I used for each video.

So after watching each video I recommend that take a look at these notesand  try following along on your local workstation. I cannot emphasis enough how important it is that you practice by actually using Kubernetes rather than just wathing the video. It help you to get comfortable with actually using Kubernetes and is a great way to prepare you to using kubernetes in the workplace.

There can be several ways to perform the same kubernetes task. When that's the case I'll Usually cover 1, or maybe 2 approaches in the video and I'll mention the rest in the course notes.


I've included links to all online resources that I mention in each video, such as github repos and blog articles. I've also include links to other resources that expands on the topics covered in the video and gives more indepth info.


There's also a study guide to accompany this course which you can find on github.Â
