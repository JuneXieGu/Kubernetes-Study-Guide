Chrome -> vscode

Each video comes with some course notes. These notes have all the example commands and sample files I used for each video.

So after watching each video I recommend that take a look at these notesand  try following along on your local workstation. I cannot emphasis enough how important it is that you practice by actually using Kubernetes rather than just wathing the vidoe. It help build confidence and make you comfortable using Kubernetes.

There can be several ways perform the same kubernetes task. When that's the case I'll Usually cover 1, or maybe 2 approaches in the video and I'll mention the others in the course notes.


I've included links to all online resources that I mention in each video, such as github repos and blog articles.


There's also a study guide to accompany this course which you can find on github.Â 


During the demo's, I'll usually have the side bar minimised by toggling the explorer icon so that there's more screen space for the actual demo itself.
