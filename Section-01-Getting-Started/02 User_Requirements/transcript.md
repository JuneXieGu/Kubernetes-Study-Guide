Ok, So what skill and experience do you need to have to get the most out of this course.

First you need to know Linux and have lots of experience using a bash terminal. Let's do a quick check, if you have experience using most of these commands then it's safe to say you meet this requirement.


If not, then I would suggest stopping here and brushing up your Linux skills before continuing with this course.



The 2nd thing you need to have experience with is Docker. What are docker images and containers? and how they are used in practice. That's important because Kubernetes is a Container orchestration platform so if you don't know what containers are in the first place then a lot of this course won't make sense to you.


Here's another quick fire check to see what your docker knowledge is like.


If you're familiar with most of these commands, then I would say you're ready to continue with this course. Otherwise I suggest take some time to become competent in Docker first.


This should give you a general idea, of the level you should be at before starting this course.
