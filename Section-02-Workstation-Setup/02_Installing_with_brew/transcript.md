I'll be doing most of my demos in a command line terminal and for that I'll be using zsh as my shell.






My workstation is a macos so I'll be installing everything using brew. In the next few videos' I'll be installing the following list of software.

- watch
- zsh (oh my zsh framework) along with plugins.
- zsh-syntax-highlighting
- iterm2
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Text editor for writing our code. themes and plugins
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) - Used for building Virtual Machines on your local workstation
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) - The main tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters
- [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) - Used for running Kubernetes locally on your workstation

For my terminal, I'll be using iterm2. iterm2 has a loads of extra features when compared to the MacOS's default terminal. For example     I can split a iterm2 terminal into multiple smaller terminals.
