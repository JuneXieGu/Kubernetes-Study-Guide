Alright. Let's take a look at my terminal setup.

```
click rocket icon - then search for 'term'
```


In this course I won't be using my macos's builtin terminal. Instead I've installed a popular alternative called iterm2. It shows iterm on the launch screen here, but it actually called iterm2 after you open it up.

```
open terminal -> hover over the header
```


iterm2 has a lot of cool capabilites and customization options, one of my favourite feature is that it lets me easily split my terminal into smaller terminals.

```
do vertical and horizontal splits
```

So if you're a mac user then you might like to give iterm2 a try.
