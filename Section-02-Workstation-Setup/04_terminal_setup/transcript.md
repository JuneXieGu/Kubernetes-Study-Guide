Alright. Let's take a look at my terminal setup.

```
click rocket icon - then search for 'term'
```


In this course I won't be using the builtin terminal that comes with my macOS. Instead I've installed a popular alternative called iterm2. It shows up as iterm on the launch screen here, but it actually called iterm2 after you open it up.

```
open terminal -> hover over the header
```


iterm2 has a lot of real cool features and customization options, one of my favourite is that you can easily split the terminal into smaller terminals.

```
do vertical and horizontal splits
```

iterm2 is only available on macs. So if you're a mac user then you might like to give iterm2 a try.



For everyone else, you may already be happy with the terminal that you're currently using, but if not, then there's another terminal that looks quite promising and it's called hyper.
