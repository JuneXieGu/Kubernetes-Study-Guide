I'll be using my local workstation for performing all the demos. 
My workstation is a Apple macbook Pro. And i have macos catalina running on it.


So if you're using macos or a Linux based os such as ubuntu, then you shouldn't have too much problem following along with the course demos. 


If you're a windows user, then things can get more complicated for you, at least initially for installing the necessary
software on your windows machine and configuring them. But hopefully everything will be downhill after that. 


Speaking of software, here's what you need to have installed on your workstation: 

##Â Must have. 
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) - This is the main tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters
- [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) - This is a tool for creating a Kubernetes cluster that's running direclty on your local workstation
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) - This is used for 
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) - we 

Up first we have kubectl, this is the main kubernetes command line tool that this whole course is about. kubectl is the client side tool that's
used for talking to your Kubernetes instance. By the end this course you'll be typing out kubectl commands in your sleep. 

Next we have minikube. this let's you deploy a single-node cluster running locally on your workstation. 
It's really easy to use and this cluster is in the form of a vm that's running on your workstation, so you're workstation
will need to have some spare cpu cores and memory to spin up this vm. Minikube needs to use a hypervisor to provision the vm,
and by default it will look to use virtualbox, which is why I've added that to the must-have list as well. 


Ok so that's a list of must-have tools. 
There are a few other less :




- watch
- zsh (oh my zsh framework) along with plugins.
- zsh-syntax-highlighting
- iterm2
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Text editor for writing our code. themes and plugins
