I'll be spending a lot of time showing demos on my workstation.

My workstation is Apple macbook Pro. And i have macos catalina running on it.


But the demos should work in nearly the same was as other Linux distros such as ubuntu or debian.

If you're a windows user however then things can get more complicated for you
and you might need to spend more time googling for workarounds and reading the official documentation.

That's why i recommend trying to get hold of a linux or mac workstation instead. It will make your life a lot easier.

There are still difference when using a macos when compared to other linux distros,
For example to install software on macos I use a package manager called homebrew but for a ubuntu you need to use apt.
In those cases I'll leave it to you to read the official documentation for your Operating System.


Next we're going to look at the software I've installed on my workstation.
