There are a small handful of other tools I'll be using in this course.


These are just general tools that I'll be use as teaching aids. So you don't have to install them unless you want to. But if you did want to install them then most of these are installed using your usual package manager, such as yum, apt, or homebrew for macs.

In the next few videos I'll be explain what these tools do and give a quick demo of them.
