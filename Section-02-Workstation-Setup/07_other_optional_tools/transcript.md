There are a small handful of other tools I'm going to use in this course.


These are just some general utilities that I'll be using as teaching aids and they're not anything specific to Kubernetes.

So you don't have to install them unless you want to. And if you did want to install them then most of these are installed using your usual package manager, such as yum, apt, or homebrew for macs.

In the next few videos I'm going to go over each of these tools and give a quick demo of them.
