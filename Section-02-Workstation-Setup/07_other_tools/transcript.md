There are a small handful of other tools I'll be using. I've listed them out in the course notes and most of them are installed using your usual package manager, for example in my case I would do `brew install` followed by the package name.




These are just general tools that I'll be use as teaching aids. They are optional tools so you don't need to install them if you don't want to.

In the next few videos I'll be giving a quick demo on what these tools do.
