The bat tool is an alternative to the cat command, but has some really powerful features, the key one being that it supports syntax highlighting:

```
ls -l
bat po...
```

Not only that but it can also display the output in a nicely formatted way, with headers and line numbers.

Theres a number of syntax highlighting themes available and you can preview them using list-themes flag.

```
bat --list-themes
```


The bat tool is something I never realised how badly I wanted it until I saw it in action.

There's a similar way to enable syntax highlight for the `less` command - https://gist.github.com/textarcana/4611277#gistcomment-1669428






Finding this tools gave me some mixed emotions. First I was Overjoyed because it's such an awesome tool and fills in the gaps that cat is lacking. But I also felt extremely annoyed because I had to put up with cat for so long before disovering bat.


It's a bit like watching a tv in black-and-white for 10 years and then discovering that there's a button on your remote control that switches your tv to color!!! Any way, never mind at least I found it now.
