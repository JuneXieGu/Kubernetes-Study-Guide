The bat tool is just an alternative



The bat tool is something I never realised how badly I wanted it until I discovered it.

Finding this tools gave me some mixed emotions. First I was Overjoyed because it's such an awesome tool and fills in the gaps that cat is lacking. But I also felt extremely annoyed because I had to put up with cat for so long before disovering bat.


It's a bit like watching a tv in black-and-white for 10 years and then discovering that there's a button on your remote control that switches your tv to color!!! Any way, never mind at least I found it now.
