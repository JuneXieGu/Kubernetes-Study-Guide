I'll be using my local workstation for performing all the demos.
My workstation is a Apple macbook Pro. And i have macos catalina running on it.


So if you're a mac or linux user, then you shouldn't have too much problem following along with the course demos.


If you're a windows user, then things can get more complicated for you, at least initially for installing the necessary
software on your windows machine and configuring them. But hopefully everything will be downhill after that.


Speaking of software, here's what you need to have installed on your workstation:

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) - This is the main tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters
- [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) - This is a tool for creating a Kubernetes cluster that's running direclty on your local workstation
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) - we

We'll walk through the install process for these tools in the upcoming videos. But for now let's quickly go over what these are.

Up first we have kubectl, this is the main kubernetes command line tool, it's a client side tool that's used for talking to your Kube clusters . This entire course is essentially all about how to use this tool. kubectl. By the end this course you'll be able to write kubectl commands in your sleep.

Next we have minikube. this is used for creating a single-node kube cluster running directly on your local workstation.
It's really easy to use and this cluster is in the form of a vm that's running on your workstation, so you're workstation
will need to have some spare cpu cores and memory to spin up this vm. However don't worry if your workstation isnt powerful enough to run minikube. In this course I'll also show you how to build a kubecluster in the cloud for free using Digital Ocean.

Finally we have docker. The chances are you already have this installed. We don't actually use docker that much in this course.
But I've listed it here because minikube needs to use a hypervisor to spin up vm and docker comes with a builtin hypervisor that minikube can use.


Ok so that's some of main tools we'll be using in this course. There are other tools we'll be using too,
and we'll introduce them along the way.
