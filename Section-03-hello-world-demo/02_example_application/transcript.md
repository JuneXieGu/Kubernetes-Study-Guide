We'll use a simple web server as our example application for the next few sections of this couurse. 

I'll be runnign this applcation inside a container and I'll be using the ubiquitous apache webserver as the software to run my example web server app.

I'll be creating my container using the official apache docker hub image. This image's name, httpd, is actually the same name as the name of the process that runs when you start an apache web server, which is also httpd. It's short for http daemon. However I tend to refer to this image as just the apache image.
