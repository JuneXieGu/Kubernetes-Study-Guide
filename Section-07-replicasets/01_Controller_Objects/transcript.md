Hello everyone and welcome back.

Ok we've covered a lot of really good stuff in the past few videos. However things are going get even more interesting because we're now going to level up and start playing with controller objects.

But what are controller objects I hear you say?


Controller objects are Kubernetes       objects that in turn creates other kubernetes objects. There are a number of controller objects. They include replicasets, deployments, and statefulsets. We'll cover all of them in due course, but for now we'll take a look at replicasets.

A replicaset is used for creating multiple replicas of a pod, hence the name replicaset. You need to create replica pods if you want to implement high-availability and loadbalancing capabilities for your application.

We'll explain how to implement these 2 features, when we cover clusterIP services later in the course.

Ok lets take a break here. In the next video we're going to create our first replicaset.

So stay tuned.









We'll cover those capabilities in the video about clusterIP services, later in the course.
